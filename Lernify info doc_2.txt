Would you like me to:
Start working on the assessment system?
Begin implementing progress analytics?
Focus on adaptive learning features?
Work on time management features?



do:

Core placement test system
Difficulty manager
API routes
Frontend components

Implement the frontend components that use this system
2. Add test coverage
Set up monitoring and logging
4. Add performance optimizations if needed
